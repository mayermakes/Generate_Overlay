# Generate_Overlay
A simpe utility to generate the files for Overlay / custom keypad production. goal is to directly export form kicad / freecad eventually. 

for now this is only some python code generated with the help of AI
and a shell script to install dependencies.
dxf files are usually requested from manufacturers like JRPanel and these must be manually exported from your design tool.
Place the files in a folder, or upload on github and not the url/folder path.
run ./install_dependencies.sh
run python generate_overlay.py

enter colors as prompted, enter filename as prompted.
you should now have dxf file a color list and a pdf with the production instructions.

very rudimentaryx and crude.
please help.
